This is a fully responsive personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It presents a clean layout with section-based navigation, showcasing an introduction, technical and soft skills, projects, education, certifications, and contact information. Designed with a mobile-first approach, the interface features gradient styling, interactive cards, and smooth transitions that provide a professional and modern user experience.

What made this project interesting was implementing dynamic content switching and mobile responsiveness without any external frameworks. It was exciting to create a visually consistent UI using pure CSS and organize all content in a structured, tab-based layout. The most challenging part was handling responsiveness and visual balance across large sections like education, certifications, and projects. In future iterations, I aim to add form functionality, integrate a backend for contact submissions, and include downloadable resumes and project demos. This project effectively demonstrates my front-end skills and my ability to create engaging and accessible user interfaces.
